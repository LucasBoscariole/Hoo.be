## Instructions

#### Step 1 

Clone the this github repository

#### Step 2

Run

``
npm install
npm run dev
``

#### Step 3

This will open 

`http://localhost:3000`

Please, redirect to `http://localhost:3000/upwork_coding_task`


Notes: 

I created an api endpoint here with next js in order to replicate a backend functionality - I'm also a fullstack developer, with that I'm getting static paths which in this case is only one page, the 'upwork_coding_task'

In this data, I found it a little bit empty, I added some fields `imageUrl` on both user and content with image. I also updated the youtube video link, which now is possible to be embeded in order to display. 

I see that this would be the only page to be done, I didn't did the modal on `create your hoo.be` because it was not enough time. Based on backend the content display can be improved for better best pratice.

Let me know if any question or anything else needs to be done. 

Have a great day!
